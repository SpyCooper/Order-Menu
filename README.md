This was a project for my Intro to Computer Science II class. The idea for the project is this:
- We have 5 different products we are selling, each having it's own variables/customizations that all pull from the Product Class
- The program is made mimic someone ordering products from the fake business
- When run, a menu appears in the console with the following options: Add a product, view the sum of the order, show all ordered products, remove a product, and end the program
- When something is added or removed from the order, the backup data file is updated to reflect what happened when the program is exited
- When the program is loaded back up, it reads in the data from the data file
